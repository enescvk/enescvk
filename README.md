## Hi, I am Enes Cevik.

I'm an Industrial Engineering graduate from KoÃ§ University, passionate about transforming data into valuable insights. My career journey began as a business analyst, but over time, Iâ€™ve transitioned into a data analyst role where I thrive on extracting, analyzing, and interpreting data to support informed business decisions.

### What I Do:
- **Data Analysis & Manipulation**: Using Python, SQL, Pandas, Numpy, and R to manipulate and interpret large datasets; PySpark for big data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful and impactful visualizations with tools like Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau, and mapping geographic data with KeplerGL.
- **Web Scraping & Data Mining**: Experienced in mining data using BeautifulSoup.

### My Approach:
I am a strong advocate for data-driven decision-making. I believe in closing the gap between analytics, strategic planning, finance, and management to help businesses turn raw data into actionable insights. With 3 years of experience, I specialize in:
- **Project Management**
- **Predictive Modeling & Forecasting**  
- **Data Pipeline Development & ETL**  
- **Process Automation**  
- **Innovation & Growth**

I pride myself on my ability to analyze, model, structure, and interpret data, developing a systemic and analytical view of business indicators and processes.

### Tech Iâ€™m Fluent In:
- Programming languages & tools: Python, R, SQL, Spark, PySpark, MS Excel, Google Sheets
- Visualization: Tableau, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Web scraping: BeautifulSoup

I am currently learning web scraping to automate data collection from various online sources, streamline data extraction for analysis, and integrate real-time data into my projects, enabling more accurate and timely insights. 

I have a strong interest in investing and trading strategies, and I'm currently working on developing backtesting mechanisms to evaluate the performance of these strategies. Additionally, Iâ€™m exploring how AI can be incorporated into the decision-making process to enhance trading outcomes.
